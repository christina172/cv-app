# CV-app
CV application (The Odin Project, JavaScript Path, JavaScript Course, React JS)

My first React JS project. I used class components, destructuring assignment and imported format() function from date-fns library.

This is a CV app, which allows the user to create a CV consisting of 3 sections: General information, Education and training and Work experience. The 1st section has submit and edit buttons. The 2nd and the 3rd sections have an add button and each block inside these sections created by clicking the add button has edit and submit buttons.
